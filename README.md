# My reinforecment learning snake demo 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo shows impressively how the reinforecement algorithm automatically trains the snake in the given environment. It learns by trial and error. After about 100 iterations we see clearly an improvement and the snake learns and gets longer and longer....


## Installation

Create python environment:

```
mkdir snakeai 
python3 -m venv snakeai
source /snakeai/bin/activate
```

Install requirements 

```
pip3 install torch, pygame, iPython

```


## Note
You can adjust the speed of training in file game.py, parameter SPEED = 500 (set high in order to see fast results).
